# How to set H2 Database as Datasource

## Dependency

```groovy
dependencies {
    runtimeOnly 'com.h2database:h2'
}
```

If you add h2 to the dependency, Spring Boot automatically configures the DataSource in-memory DB using the default setting of h2.



## Properties

```yaml
spring:
  datasource: # (1)
    url: jdbc:h2:file:./test
    username: sa # default
    password: # default
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver # default
  h2.console.enabled: true # (2)
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create # (3)
    properties:
      hibernate:
        format_sql: true # (4)
logging:
  level:
    org.hibernate.SQL: debug # (5)
```

(1) Set up a datasource. If you use `file` in url, datasource works with the file specified in url instead of in-memory. The file path appears after the colon after "file", If it starts with `/`, it indicates an absolute path, and if it starts with `./`, it indicates a relative path (project root folder). `username` and `password` are used to log in to the DB console. In `driver-class-name`, the name of the driver to be used when connecting to the DB is specified. The part commented with "# defaut" operates as a default value even if you do not set it separately.  
(2) If set to true, the DB console can be used.  
(3) If set to `create`, new schemas are created every time the application is run. If schemas exist, these are created again after dropping all of them. Therefore, it should not be used in a commercial environment.  
(4) Format the log and output it.  
(5) Print SQL related log.
